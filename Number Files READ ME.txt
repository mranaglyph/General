This quick program is pretty simple.
If you have a bunch of files that you would like renamed in 
numerical order [0, 1, 2...], Number Files will ask you for 
the path of the file(s) to rename, then it will ask for the 
extension of the file(s), and it will rename all the files 
in a particular folder!

General Notes:
This doesn't just pick the files at random to rename!
It uses the 'Date Modified' data of a file to determine where it 
should fall in the sequential list. In other words, the newer 
a modification to a file, the higher a number it will be when renamed.

Example:
File Modified Yesterday --> Renamed to --> 0
File Modified Today     --> Renamed to --> 1

Potential Issues: 
If two files have the same modified date, there will be an issue, 
but the program should tell you which file had the trouble being 
renamed, so I recommend modifying the file(s) it is stuck on and trying
again.

If two files have the same name, this program won't rename it, 
so make sure you don't have a file named as the same number. Again, 
it should tell you which one it is having trouble with, so you can 
rename it/them manually, and try again. 

When you are asked for the file extension, keep in mind 
EVERY file in that folder/path will be renamed with the extension
you provide. If you have multiple file types in the same folder, 
do yourself a favor, and move them first. 

Final Note:
This program is just an attempt to try to reduce the effort of renaming
files (of the same type) in bulk, but it is not perfect. That being said, 
I hope you get some good use out of it, and enjoy!
